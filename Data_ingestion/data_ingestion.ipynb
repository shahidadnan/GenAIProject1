       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'speech.txt'}, page_content='Malcolm X was one of the most dynamic, dramatic and influential figures of the civil rights era. He was an apostle of black nationalism, self respect, and uncompromising resistance to white oppression. Malcolm X was a polarizing figure who both energized and divided African Americans, while frightening and alienating many whites. He was an unrelenting truth-teller who declared that the mainstream civil rights movement was naïve in hoping to secure freedom through integration and nonviolence. The blazing heat of Malcolm X\\'s rhetoric sometimes overshadowed the complexity of his message, especially for those who found him threatening in the first place. Malcolm X was assassinated at age 39, but his political and cultural influence grew far greater in the years after his death than when he was alive.\\n\\nMalcolm X is now popularly seen as one of the two great martyrs of the 20th century black freedom struggle, the other being his ostensible rival, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. But in the spring of 1964, when Malcolm X gave his \"Ballot or the Bullet\" speech, he was regarded by a majority of white Americans as a menacing character. Malcolm X never directly called for violent revolution, but he warned that African Americans would use \"any means necessary\" – especially armed self defense – once they realized just how pervasive and hopelessly entrenched white racism had become.1\\n\\nHe was born Malcolm Little in 1925 in Omaha, Nebraska. His father, Earl, was a Baptist preacher and follower of the black nationalist Marcus Garvey. Earl Little\\'s political activism provoked threats from the Ku Klux Klan. After the family moved to Lansing, Michigan, white terrorists burned the Littles\\' home. A defiant Earl Little shot at the arsonists as they got away. In 1931, Malcolm\\'s father was found dead. His family suspected he\\'d been murdered by white vigilantes. Malcolm\\'s mother, Louise, battled mental illness and struggled to care for her eight children during the Great Depression. She was committed to a state mental institution when Malcolm was 12. He and the other young children were scattered among foster families. After completing the eighth grade, Malcolm Little dropped out when a teacher told him that his dream of becoming a lawyer was unrealistic for a \"nigger.\"2\\n\\nAs a teenager, Malcolm Little made his way to New York, where he took the street name Detroit Red and became a pimp and petty criminal. In 1946, Malcolm Little was sent to prison for burglary. He read voraciously while serving time and converted to the Black Muslim faith. He joined the Nation of Islam (NOI) and changed his name to Malcolm X, eliminating that part of his identity he called a white-imposed slave name.\\n\\nMalcom X was released in 1952 after six years in prison. With his charisma and eloquence, Malcolm rose rapidly in the Nation of Islam. He became the chief spokesman and field recruiter for NOI leader Elijah Muhammad. As historian Peniel Joseph describes it, NOI\\'s unorthodox interpretation of Islam was mixed with a doctrine of black personal responsibility and economic self-sufficiency, along with \"theological fundamentalism, anti-white mythology, and total racial separation as the means to black redemption.\"3 Wearing impeccable suits, maintaining an air of fierce dignity and adhering to a strict code of moral propriety, Malcolm X was a living demonstration of how the NOI could save a wayward people from racial submission and personal self-destruction. The Nation dismissed the conventional civil rights movement – with its protest marches and demands for equal rights legislation -- as impotent and misguided. As Malcolm X declared in this speech, the only effective solution to racial inequality was black economic and social separatism.\\n\\nAs Malcolm X\\'s national prominence grew, so did a rift between him and Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm X far overshadowed his mentor in the public sphere. He also grew disillusioned by Elijah Muhammad\\'s scandalous personal behavior; the Messenger fathered several children through affairs with his secretaries. The conflict deepened when Muhammad suspended Malcolm X for saying that President John F. Kennedy\\'s assassination represented \"the chickens coming home to roost\" because of the war in Vietnam.4 Finally, in March 1964, Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam and charted his own course of militant, black nationalism.\\n\\nOn April 12, 1964, one month after splitting with the NOI, Malcolm X gave his \"Ballot or the Bullet\" speech at King Solomon Baptist Church in Detroit (he\\'d given the address nine days earlier in Cleveland, but the Detroit version is regarded by some scholars as definitive).5 It was the fullest declaration of his black nationalist philosophy. Mainstream black ministers in Detroit tried to block Malcolm X from using the church, saying \"separatist ideas can do nothing but set back the colored man\\'s cause.\" But the church hall had already been rented out for the event.6\\n\\n\"The Ballot or the Bullet\" became one of Malcolm X\\'s most recognizable phrases, and the speech was one of his greatest orations. Two thousand people – including some of his opponents -- turned out to hear him speak in Detroit.. President Lyndon Johnson was running for reelection in 1964, and Malcolm X declared it \"the year of the ballot or the bullet.\" He outlined a new, global sensibility in the fight for racial justice: \"We intend to expand [the freedom struggle] from the level of civil rights to the level of human rights.\"\\n\\nMalcolm was now free of the NOI\\'s ban on members participating in the mainstream civil rights movement. He encouraged black militants to get involved in voter registration drives and other forms of community organizing to redefine and expand the movement.7\\n\\nThe day after his Detroit speech, Malcolm X embarked on an overseas tour that included a life-changing pilgrimage to the Muslim holy city of Mecca. Known as the Hajj, the pilgrimage must be carried out at least once in a lifetime by every able-bodied Muslim who can afford to do so. The racial diversity he experienced in the Middle East, especially among Muslims, led him to discard his strict notions of black separatism for a wider, more inclusive movement against white supremacy and colonialism. In the summer of 1964, Malcolm X announced a new effort, the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU).\\n\\nIn the last months of his life, Malcolm X\\'s conflict with the Nation of Islam grew increasingly bitter. Elijah Muhammad and the NOI had a long history of using violence and intimidation against members who strayed. In February, 1965, Malcolm X\\'s home was firebombed. He publicly blamed the Nation of Islam and predicted he would be killed. Malcolm X was shot to death on February 12, 1965 as he prepared to speak at an OAAU rally at the Audubon Ballroom in New York. Three black men, all members of the NOI, were convicted and sent to prison for the murder.\\n\\nIn an editorial after his death, The New York Times described Malcolm X as \"an extraordinary and twisted man, turning many true gifts to evil purpose.\"8 Actor and activist Ossie Davis eulogized him as \"our own black shining prince.\"9 In death, he became a seminal figure to an increasingly militant generation of young African Americans, a beacon for activists in the 1960s Black Power and Black Arts movements.\\n\\nIn assessing Malcolm X\\'s impact, theologian James Cone wrote: \"More than anyone else he revolutionized the black mind, transforming docile Negroes and self-effacing colored people into proud blacks and self-confident African-Americans.\"10 By the end of the 20th century, Malcolm X was recognized in mainstream culture as a hero of the civil rights era. The militant radical whose image once provoked fear and hatred among many white Americans was celebrated in mainstream movie theaters, on Black History Month posters in elementary school classrooms, and on a 1999 postage stamp issued by the United States government.')]"

[applause]  In fact, I'm a Black \\nNationalist freedom fighter. [applause]  Islam is my religion but I believe my religion is my \\npersonal business. [applause] It governs my personal life, my personal morals. And my religious \\nphilosophy is personal between me and the God in whom I believe, just as the religious \\nphilosophy of these others is between them and the God in whom they believe.

The time when white people can come in our \\ncommunity and get us to vote for them so that they can be our political leaders and tell us what to \\ndo and what not to do is long gone.

And then, we will –  whenever we are ready to cast our ballot, that \\nballot will be cast for a man of the community, who has the good of the community at heart. \\n[applause] \\nThe economic philosophy of black nationalism only means that we should own and operate and \\ncontrol the economy of our community.

And because these Negroes, who have \\nbeen misled, misguided, are breaking their necks to take their money and spend it with the Man, \\nthe Man is becoming richer and richer, and you're becoming poorer and poorer. And then what \\nhappens? The community in which you live becomes a slum. It becomes a ghetto. The conditions \\nbecome rundown.

But the \\npolitical and economic philosophy of black nationalism…the economic  philosophy of black \\nnationalism shows our people the importance of setting up these little stores, and developing \\nthem and expanding them into larger operations.

But singing didn\\'t help him to become the heavyweight champion of the world. \\nSwinging helped him. [applause] \\nSo this government has failed us. The government itself has failed us. And the white liberals who \\nhave been posing as our friends have failed us. And once we see that all of these other sources to \\nwhich we\\'ve turned have failed, we stop turning to them and turn to ourselves.

Because Negroes have \\nlistened to the trickery and the lies and the false promises of the white man now for too long, and \\nthey\\'re fed up. They\\'ve become disenchanted. They\\'ve become disillusioned. They\\'ve become \\ndissatisfied. And all of this has built up frustrations in the black community that makes the black \\ncommunity throughout America today more explosive than all of the atomic bombs the Russians \\ncan ever invent. Whenever you got a racial powder keg sitting in your lap, you\\'re in more trouble \\nthan if you had an atomic powder keg sitting in your lap. When a racial powder keg goes off, it \\ndoesn\\'t care who it knocks out the way. Understand this, it\\'s dangerous. \\nAnd in 1964, this seems to be the ye ar. Because what can the white man use, now, to fool us? \\nAfter he put down that March on Washington – and you see all through that now, he tricked you, \\nhad you marching down to Washington. Had you marching back and forth between the feet of a \\ndead man named Lincoln and another dead man named George Washington, singing, \"We Shall \\nOvercome.\" [applause] \\nHe made a chump out of you. He made a fool out of you. He made you think you were going \\nsomewhere and you end up going nowhere but between Lincoln and Washington. [laughter] \\nSo today our people are disillusioned. They\\'ve become disenchanted. They\\'ve become \\ndissatisfied. And in their frustrations they want action. And in 1964 you\\'ll see this young black \\nman, this new generation, asking for the ballot or the bullet. That old Uncle Tom action is \\noutdated. The young generation don\\'t want to hear anything about \"the odds are against us.\" \\nWhat do we care about odds? [applause] \\nWhen this country here was first being founded,  there were thirteen colonies. The whites were \\ncolonized. They were fed up with this taxation without representation. So some of them stood up \\nand said, \"Liberty or death!\" I went to a white school over here in Mason, Michigan. The white \\nman made the mista ke of letting me read his history books. [laughter]  He made the mistake of \\nteaching me that Patrick Henry was a patriot, and George Washington – wasn\\'t nothing non-\\nviolent about ol\\' Pat, or George Washington. \"Liberty or death\" is was what brought about the \\nfreedom of whites in this country from the English. [applause] \\nThey didn\\'t care about the odds. Why, they faced the wrath of the entire British Empire. And in \\nthose days, they used to say that the British Empire was so vast and so powerful that the sun \\nwould never set on it. This is how big it was, yet these thirteen little scrawny states, tired of \\ntaxation without representation, tired of being exploited and oppressed and degraded, told that \\nbig British Empire, \"Liberty or death.\" And here you have 22 mi llion Afro -Americans, black \\npeople today, catching more hell than Patrick Henry ever saw. [applause] \\nAnd I\\'m here to tell you in case you don\\'t know it – that you got a new, you got a new generation \\nof black people in this country who don\\'t care anything w hatsoever about odds. They don\\'t want \\nto hear you ol\\' Uncle Tom, handkerchief -heads talking about the odds. No! [laughter, applause]  \\nThis is a new generation. If they\\'re going to draft these young black men, and send them over to \\nKorea or to South Vietnam to face 800 million Chinese… [laughter, applause]  If you\\'re not \\nafraid of those odds, you shouldn\\'t be afraid of these odds.

It was the fact that you threw 80 percent of your votes behind the \\nDemocrats that put the Democrats in the White House. \\nWhen you see this, you can see that the Negro vote is the key factor. And despite the fact that \\nyou are in a position to be the determining factor, what do you get out of it? The Democrats have \\nbeen in Washington, D.C. only because of the Negro vote.

Of the 16 senatorial committees that run \\nthe government, 10 of them are in the hands of southern segregationists.

But they got to make you go with one of \\'em or the other. \\nSo this is a con game, and this is what they\\'ve been doing with you and me all of these years. \\nFirst thing, Johnson got off the plane when he become president, he ask, \"Where\\'s Dickey?\" You \\nknow who Dickey is? Dickey is old southern cracker Richard Russell. Lookie here! Yes, Lyndon \\nB. Johnson\\'s best friend is the one who is a head, who\\'s heading the forces that are filibustering \\ncivil rights legislation. You tell me how in the hell is he going to be Johnson\\'s best frien d? \\n[applause] How can Johnson be his friend and your friend too? No, that man is too tricky. \\nEspecially if his friend is still ol\\' Dickey. [laughter, applause] \\nWhenever the Negroes keep the Democrats in power they\\'re keeping the Dixiecrats in power. \\nThis is true! A vote for a Democrat is nothing but a vote for a Dixiecrat. I know you don\\'t like \\nme saying that. I\\'m not the kind of person who come here to say what you like. I\\'m going to tell \\nyou the truth whether you like it or not.

Even though \\nyou can vote they fix it so you\\'re voting for nobody. They got you going and coming. In the \\nSouth they\\'re outright political wolves, in the North they\\'re political foxes. A fox and a wolf are \\nboth canine, both belong to the dog family. [laughter, applause]  Now, you take your choice. \\nYou going to choose a northern dog or a southern dog?

It\\'s freedom for everybody or \\nfreedom for nobody. [applause]  America today finds herself in a unique situation. Historically, \\nrevolutions are bloody, oh yes they are.

Because the day that he can win on the ground has passed. \\nUp in French Indochina, those little peasants, rice-growers, took on the might of the French army \\nand ran all the Frenchmen, you remember Dien Bien Phu! The same thing happened in Algeria, \\nin Africa. They didn't have anything but a rifle. The French had all these highly mechanized \\ninstruments of warfare. But they put some guerilla action on.

When the government of Portugal began to trample \\nupon the rights of our brothers and sisters in Angola, it was taken before the U.N.

And just this week, Chief Justice Goldberg \\nwas crying over three million Jews in Russia, about their human rights –  charging Russia with \\nviolating the U.N.

Now \\nyou tell me why the leaders of this struggle have ne ver taken [recording impaired ] [their case to \\nthe U.N.?] \\nSo our next move is to take the entire civil rights struggle – problem – into the United Nations \\nand let the world see that Uncle Sam is guilty of violating the human rights of 22 million Afro -\\nAmericans right down to the year of 1964 and still has the audacity or the nerve to stand up and \\nrepresent himself as the leader of the free world? [cheering]  Not only is he a crook, he's a \\nhypocrite. Here he is standing up in front of other people, Uncle Sam, with the blood of your and \\nmine mothers and fathers on his hands. With the blood dripping down his jaws like a bloody -\\njawed wolf. And still got the nerve to point his finger at other countries. In 1964 you can't even \\nget civil rights legislation and this man has got the nerve to stand up and talk about South Africa \\nor talk about Nazi Germany or talk about Portugal. No, no more days like those! [applause] \\nSo I say in my conclusion, the only way we're going to solve it: we got to unite. We got to work \\ntogether in unity and harmony. And black nationalism is the key. How we gonna overcome the \\ntendency to be at each other's throats that always exists in our neighborhood? And the reason this \\ntendency exists – the strategy of the white man has always been divide and conquer. He keeps us \\ndivided in order to conquer us. He tells you, I'm for separation and you for integration, and keep \\nus fighting with each other. No, I'm not for separation and you're not for integration, what you \\nand I are for is freedom. [applause] Only, you think that integration will get you freedom; I think \\nthat separation will get me freedom. We both got the same objective, we just got different ways \\nof getting' at it. [applause] \\nSo I studied this man, Billy Graham, who preaches white nationalism . That's what he preaches. \\n[applause] I say, that's what he preaches. The whole church structure in this country is white \\nnationalism, you go inside a white church – that's what they preaching, white nationalism.

A spokesman for the Nation of Islam (NOI) until 1964, after which he left the movement, he was a vocal advocate for Black empowerment and the promotion of Islam within the African American community. A controversial figure accused of preaching violence, Malcolm X is also a celebrated figure within African American and Muslim communities for his pursuit of racial justice.\\nMalcolm spent his adolescence living in a series of foster homes and with various relatives, after his father\\'s death and his mother\\'s hospitalization. He committed various crimes, being sentenced to eight to ten years in prison in 1946 for larceny and burglary. In prison, he joined the Nation of Islam, adopting the name Malcolm X to symbolize his unknown African ancestral surname while discarding \"the white slavemaster name of \\'Little\\'\", and after his parole in 1952, he quickly became one of the organization\\'s most influential leaders. He was the public face of the organization for 12 years, advocating Black empowerment and separation of Black and White Americans, as well as criticizing Martin Luther King Jr. and the mainstream civil rights movement for its emphasis on non-violence and racial integration.

From the 1950s onward, Malcolm X was subjected to surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\\nIn the 1960s, Malcolm X began to grow disillusioned with the Nation of Islam, as well as with its leader, Elijah Muhammad. He subsequently embraced Sunni Islam and the civil rights movement after completing the Hajj to Mecca and became known as \"el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz\", which roughly translates to \"The Pilgrim Malcolm the Patriarch\". After a brief period of travel across Africa, he publicly renounced the Nation of Islam and founded the Islamic Muslim Mosque, Inc. (MMI) and the Pan-African Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU). Throughout 1964, his conflict with the Nation of Islam intensified, and he was repeatedly sent death threats. On February 21, 1965, he was assassinated in New York City. Three Nation members were charged with the murder and given indeterminate life sentences. In 2021, two of the convictions were vacated.

Earl was an outspoken Baptist lay speaker, and he and Louise were admirers of Pan-African activist Marcus Garvey. Earl was a local leader of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) and Louise served as secretary and \"branch reporter\", sending news of local UNIA activities to Negro World; they inculcated self-reliance and black pride in their children. Malcolm X later said that White violence killed four of his father\\'s brothers.\\nBecause of Ku Klux Klan threats, Earl\\'s UNIA activities were said to be \"spreading trouble\" and the family relocated in 1926 to Milwaukee, and shortly thereafter to Lansing, Michigan.'),\n",

Malcolm X fell out with the NOI and the group\\'s leader, Elijah Muhammad, after Malcolm X made provocative remarks about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and condemned Muhammad\\'s sexual relationships with several underage girls. Malcolm X publicly announced his departure from the NOI in March 1964.\\nIn February, a leader of Temple Number Seven ordered the bombing of Malcolm X\\'s car. In March, Elijah Muhammad told Boston minister Louis X (later known as Louis Farrakhan) that \"hypocrites like Malcolm should have their heads cut off\"; the April 10 edition of Muhammad Speaks featured a cartoon depicting Malcolm X\\'s bouncing, severed head.\\nOn June 8, FBI surveillance recorded a telephone call in which Betty Shabazz was told that her husband was \"as good as dead\". Four days later, an FBI informant received a tip that \"Malcolm X is going to be bumped off.\" That same month, the Nation sued to reclaim Malcolm X\\'s residence in East Elmhurst, Queens, New York. His family was ordered to vacate but on February 14, 1965\\u200d—\\u200cthe night before a hearing on postponing the eviction\\u200d—\\u200cthe house was destroyed by fire.\\nOn July 9, Muhammad aide John Ali (suspected of being an undercover FBI agent) referred to Malcolm X by saying, \"Anyone who opposes the Honorable Elijah Muhammad puts their life in jeopardy.\" In the December 4 issue of Muhammad Speaks, Louis X wrote that \"such a man as Malcolm is worthy of death.\"\\nThe September 1964 issue of Ebony dramatized Malcolm X\\'s defiance of these threats by publishing a photograph of him holding an M1 carbine while peering out of a window.\\n\\nOn February 18, Malcolm X relayed in an interview that he was a \"marked man\", referring to his severed ties with the Nation and how it would ultimately be the reason for his demise. He went on to say that, \"No one can get out without trouble, and this thing with me will be resolved by death and violence.\"\\nOn February 19, 1965, Malcolm X told interviewer Gordon Parks that the Nation of Islam was actively trying to kill him.\\n\\n\\n== Assassination ==\\n\\nOn February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was preparing to address the Organization of Afro-American Unity in Manhattan\\'s Audubon Ballroom when someone in the 400-person audience yelled,\\n\"Nigger! Get your hand outta my pocket!\" As Malcolm X and his bodyguards tried to quell the disturbance, a man rushed forward and shot him once in the chest with a sawed-off shotgun and two other men charged the stage firing semi-automatic handguns. Malcolm X was pronounced dead at 3:30 pm, shortly after arriving at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. The autopsy identified 21 gunshot wounds to the chest, left shoulder, arms and legs, including ten buckshot wounds from the initial shotgun')]"
